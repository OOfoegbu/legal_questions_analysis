# EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF LEGAL QUESTIONS

## Project Description
The goal of this project was to build a classification model that accepts as input, text description of legal questions, and outputs an appropriate legal category for the question. This model would be helpful in pointing users to the most suited legal speciality for their cases.

In this repo, I have included a link to the exploratory analysis report for this project. The exploration was aimed at answering certain questions which would be useful in advicing a legal firm on how to deplore its resources. I have placed the classification modelling report in a separate repo called legal_questions_classification.

Python is the programming language used in this project.
